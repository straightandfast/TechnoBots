Our mentor warned us against the problem of our bot toppling over. 
This motivated us to come up with the Sandwich model and we designed a bot that would work in both orientations.
Though we had some second thoughts during the making of the bot our tireless efforts came to fruition 
when we saw how well the bot was holding up.
Our XLR8 journey was full of ups and downs. 
We have been through everything from the most frustrating bit of soldering to a faulty ESP32!
Watching our bot cakewalk through the obstacle course was especially rewarding.
