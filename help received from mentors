Our team mentor, Kshaunish, helped us come up with the design and gave us some much needed tips.
Also all the other mentors were of immense help especially when we discovered on the day of the final run that our ESP32 needed to be replaced.
They helped us get a new one and get it coded and connected as soon as possible.
