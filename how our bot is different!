We had implemented the Sandwich model in our bot by designing it such that it would run even if it topples over.
We made this design by sandwiching all our electrical components and motors between two acrylic sheets.
This proved to be especially useful during our final XLR8 run.
The big wheels on our bot combined with the unique Sandwich model helped it run smoothly on every obstacle in the course.
